## About This Project
I first created this project in January 2019 and the initial version took about 2 months to complete launching in March 2019. The end goal was to land my first tech job, which it worked. This very site got me my first tech job at [CNC Machines](https://cncmachines.com) as a front-end developer.

Fast-foward 13 months to April 2020, I've had two different jobs at startups. Turns out it's not really my thing. I'm open-sourcing the entire codebase for this project under the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), but just know that the name of the live site may change. I'm leaving it up to the community to decide what to do.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome, but I don't currently have any guidelines for that. I promise to make some soon though, stay tuned. In the meantime, might want to watch the repo and star it, so you get notified when that happens.
